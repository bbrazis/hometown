YES!
✅ image alt descriptions - add one for your profile pic too!
✅ class naming conventions
✅ great commenting
✅ CSS pretty consistent

HTML
- semantic HTML to separate sections

images
- naming conventions
- always good to try to make images the same size
originally they are:
- park - 500 X 375
- wineries: 960 X 484
- snoopy: 728 X 415

CSS
- line 20 not using h4 & h5, remove
- line 87 place media query at the bottom of the file
- line 123 is showing an error
- line 105 & 108 using relative and absolute: take advantage of flexbox
    instead
        - this will cause issues, so will need to rearrange where the profile image appears in code so it becomes a child of the flexbox div, and will also need to create a new class for the profile image instead of using "card-image" class and add this style to media query too.
